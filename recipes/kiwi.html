    <p>Dehydrated Kiwis Will Be Your New Grab-and-Go Snack</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2 kiwis</li>
    <li>air fryer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Peel the kiwi with a paring knife or a vegetable peeler.</li>
    <li>Slice the kiwi into ¼ inch or ½ inch slices. When you slice the kiwi thinner, it dehydrates faster. Keep this in mind if you want your kiwi done sooner. </li>
    <li>Cover the dehydrator and set the temperature to 135 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>Check the kiwi after six hours. Depending on how thickly you sliced the kiwi, it could take up to 12 hours for them to be completely dehydrated.</li>
    <li>Once 5 minutes has elapsed, release any remaining pressure in Instant Pot by using a wooden spoon or kitchen towel to knock vent knob to vent position.</li>
