<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The perfect technique for cooking hard boiled eggs in the pressure cooker is the 5-5-5 method.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>half dozen eggs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Place 1 cup of COLD water in the inner pot of pressure cooker (liquid is ALWAYS needed for the pressure cooker to be able to reach pressure.</li>
    <li>Place eggs in egg rack or carefully on top of the rack that the Instant Pot came with and seal. </li>
    <li>Set cook time to 5 minutes (5 minutes on high pressure--push the manual button and adjust the timer to 5 minutes)</li>
    <li>After cook time has elapsed, let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes (I suggest setting a timer that will beep at 5 minutes so you don't lose track of time. )</li>
    <li>Once 5 minutes has elapsed, release any remaining pressure in Instant Pot by using a wooden spoon or kitchen towel to knock vent knob to vent position.</li>
    <li>Carefully, remove eggs from the pressure cooker and place it in an ice bath. Eggs are VERY hot, so use potholder if your fingers aren't made of steel!</li>
    <li>After eggs have been in an ice bath for 5 minutes, remove eggs from the ice bath.</li>
